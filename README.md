## 💻 How to get Credential (Endfield)

Follow these steps to connect the assistant to your account.

### Step 1: Log in to Portal
* Log in to the [SKPort Endfield Portal](https://game.skport.com/endfield/sign-in) with your account.

### Step 2: Open Developer Tools
* Press `F12` (or `Ctrl+Shift+I` / `Cmd+Option+I`) on your browser.
* Navigate to the **Application** tab.

### Step 3: Get ACCOUNT_TOKEN (Required for both GS & Python)
1. On the left sidebar, go to **Storage** -> **Cookies**.
2. Select `https://game.skport.com`.
3. **Refresh the page** (F5).
4. Find the cookie named `ACCOUNT_TOKEN` and copy its **Value**.

### Step 4: Get SK-GAME-ROLE (Required for Python / Optional for GS)

## 🚀 1. Auto Check-in (Google Apps Script - ☁️ Cloud & Free)

This is the recommended method. It runs automatically on Google's servers without needing your PC to be on.

**✨ Features:**
- **Auto-Detect Roles:** Automatically finds all characters in your account (Asia, USA, TW, etc.).
- **Multi-Server Support:** Checks in for *every* character found, not just the main one.
- **Zero Config:** Just paste your Token, no need to find Role IDs manually.
- **Discord Notify:** Sends beautiful notifications with dynamic timestamps.

### 🛠️ Setup Guide
1. Go to [Google Apps Script](https://script.google.com/) and create a **New Project**.
2. Copy the entire code from `endfield_checkin.gs` and paste it into the editor.
3. **Configuration:**
   - Paste your `ACCOUNT_TOKEN` into the `ACCOUNT_LIST`.
   - (Optional) Paste your `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL`.
   - **No need to fill `roleId`**, the script will handle it automatically!
4. Click the **Save** icon (💾) or press `Ctrl + S`.
5. Select `runFullProcess` from the top dropdown menu and click **▶ Run** to test it once. (Grant necessary permissions if prompted).

### ⏰ How to set up Trigger (Run Automatically)
1. On the left sidebar, click the **Triggers** icon (⏰).
2. Click **+ Add Trigger** at the bottom right.
3. Set up the trigger as follows:
   - Choose which function to run: `runFullProcess`
   - Select event source: `Time-driven`
   - Select type of time based trigger: `Day timer`
   - Select time of day: `3am to 4am` (or any time you prefer)
4. Click **Save**. Done! The script will now check-in for you every day.
